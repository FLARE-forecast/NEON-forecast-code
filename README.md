# NEON-forecast-code

## Above is the code needed to run  the National Ecological Observatory Network lake forecasts. 
To run this code, you will need R v4.0.x or higher and ample space to store all of the NEON meterological and observation data. We suggest an external hard drive or external server as the NEON data will take up a large portion of available space on your local computer. 

To get a sense exactly how FLARE runs, we strongly suggest exploring the Bookdown document written by Dr. Quinn Thomas. This provides step by step instructions how FLARE operates and has a wonderful example forecast in a local drinking water reservoir in Virginia, USA.
